Entomlia CMS

The main assumption of the project is to enable the creation of a database structure directly from the CMS. Therefore, the individual content management modules will be generated dynamically, and you do not need a developer who would create modules in a traditional way.

Two databases are required. The main database stores the CMS configuration and information about the structures of individual modules. The second database will store the content added by the administrator.

Each service has its README.md file in its directory.  
API: [README.MD](api/README.MD)  
CMS: [README.MD](cms/README.md)
